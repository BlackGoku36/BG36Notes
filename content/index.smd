[Hi]($text.attrs('p-start')), I am Urjasvi Suthar (BlackGoku36). I like to figure out how things works and then build them from scratch. My main interests are in
low-level programming and computer graphics. Currently I am dipping my toes in embedded programming.

Other than coding, I like to write short-stories and think about forthcoming volatile multi-polar world.
