[Hi]($text.attrs('p-start')), I am Urjasvi Suthar (BlackGoku36) and currently a berozgaar. I like building things from scratch and enjoy System Programming and Computer Graphics.
Other than coding, I like watching movies and thinking about forthcoming volatile multi-polar world.

If you like whatever I do and want to talk about it, don't be shy to reach out to me :)
