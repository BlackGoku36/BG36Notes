In the previous post, we saw how to write simple code in `.wat` format, compile it, run it, look at 
the underlying structure and decode the `.wasm` binary format.

In this post we will do just that again, but this time we will move onto writing more complicated
code with conditionals, branching and loops. We will look underneath in the same way.
