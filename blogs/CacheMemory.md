# Cache Memory notes

Hopefully I actually complete this one.

Agenda:

- Explain what cache memory is and why does it matter.
- What is direct mapped, associative and set-associative cache memory.
- Simple calculations of things like cache address bits and determine different things of the cache memory that helps with understanding of data in cache.
- Different types of misses and how it can be improved.
- Real-life example of code that hate cache:
    - Multiplication of huge N matrix with sub matrix and how it can be optimised.
    - Why Linked list sucks in this regard.
- Why nobody (except those who want high performance design, I don't think cache memory is big brain thing tho) seems to give fuck about cache memory even if it taught in university.
