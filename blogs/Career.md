# Career in computer science

This blog is an attempt to help people find their passion in computer science field. Specificially for Indian students, who have jumped onto computer science bandwagon without much forethought (pushed by their parents, relative or just by thier lack of life choices).

## Fields

I believe computer is a powerful tool, that let you do amazing things, it is only limited by your own creativity and it's hardware capabilities. This means you can use code to do almost anything you can imagine it to do. Computer science have vast number of field, many of field works in tandem with other subjects such as Maths, Science, Crime, Finance, etc. These means you have vast number of options to choose from, and select the one which fits you. I will list some of field, which you can check out.

List of some of computer science fields:

- [Computer Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics)
- [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)
- [Web Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_web_design_and_web_development)
<!-- [Software engineering]() -->
<!-- Computer hardware -->

Some of fields can overlap with each other and with those outside CS, Let take games as example:
One of the major component of games is its graphics/looks. Games are developed with what called game engines (System software), game engines have component that control the graphics called render engines (Computer graphics) and in render engines, for graphics to look good, it require good amount of knowledge of Maths and for it to be fast you need understanding of System/Hardware (System Software, Computer Architecture). This being said, of course it doesn't mean that to develop game, you need good knowledge of above mentioned fields and subject. It just means that this is what goes into a game, when you dig into deeper level of technical details.

This is to show that computer science can be used in many areas of enginnering, it so big, it wouldn't be far-fetched for it to be put on same level as Maths, Physics, etc. So don't think that world is limited to things like mobile app dev or web dev.

As for Indian students, I want you to select whatever suits you the best, it doesn't have to be whatever trendy field is in India like Web dev/App dev/AI/ML. Pick whatever you like, India isn't the only country that offer jobs to programmers.
