# DSA

Data structure and algorithm is pretty important topic in CS. It help you write algorithm for any kind of data and do this efficiently. So first let see what it actually solve, how it solve and when we need to think outside of DSA.

The goods:

1. Hardware independent: Different system have different underlying working (different architecture, cpu, memory), this help you write better algorithm based on Time and Space complexity. This will ensure that one algorithm is faster than other and let you compare different algorithm.

2. Better understanding of algorithm: Understanding and calculating space/time complexity of algorithm and let you understand how you can improve the efficiency and tell you when you need to come up with enitre new algorithm instead.

3. Software independent: This include from how your operating system handle your system resources to how compiler optimize your code. Benifits here is same as that of hardware independenc point.

The bad:

1. Hardware and software independence: While it is good point, it a bad one too. Because different hardware and software have different way of functioning. Not understanding the inner working of system will make you miss potential amazing optimization. I am going to stress that this point is really important than many people imagine. While being good at DSA, is good, this one is also something that you definitely shoudln't ignore. If you don't believe me, read up on how memory cache work and google search 'Data Oriented Design'.

> Note to yall, my perspective is from that of computer graphics and game dev field. And not competitive programming (Not interested in solving imaginary problems).

Even though it has bad, this blog is title 'DSA', so we are obviously going to explore more.
