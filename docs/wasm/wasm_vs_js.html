<p>WebAssembly wasn’t designed and created to replace Javascript, but
rather complement it and make two of them work together in tandem. As we
will see, some part of code should see benefits from using WASM when
compared to JS, but some parts rather be in JS itself. We will discuss
about what problem Javascript has, how WebAssembly solves it, what are
WebAssembly limitations and benefits are over Javascript.</p>
<h2 id="what-problem-does-javascript-have">What problem does Javascript
have?</h2>
<hr />
<p>The browser has to fetch javascript code from the server, than
compile it just like any other language. Depending on how a particular
browser implement it, javascript is either compiled to bytecode, machine
code or just interpreted in old-school way. The browser has to do this
on go, and it might have to compile/interpret same piece of code
multiple time.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Download-time and Load-time latency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Browser has to fetch javascript code from server, and since the size
of a text file is lot more than size of binary file, it will take lot
more time to download which will leads to load-time latency. This is
important on web, the less data you need to download the better it is.
That is why there are programs such as js/css minifier which try to
shave of as many as bytes possible by removing whitespaces or turning
many-words identifiers into few-chars identifiers.</li>
<li>Compiler has to parse the text-file first, then convert it to code
to another format (intermediate representation), optimize it and finally
convert it to end format (such as bytecode or machine code). Parsing +
Optimization take lot of time, so we have even more latency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Execution Speed:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To decrease the above load-time latency, implementation sometimes
only compile a certain part of code instead of whole, this might means
that compile might have to compile a particular part of code again and
again. This redundancy will make the whole code lot more slower.</li>
<li>To decrease the load-time even more, the implementation can just
skip optimisation passes, which would make the resulting code lot more
slower.</li>
<li>Javascript language design such as dynamic typing and garbage
collection (automatic memory management), would make things even more
worse.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-does-it-solve-those-problems">How does it solve those
problems?</h2>
<hr />
<p>To solve the above problem, WASM was introduced.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Download-time and load-time latency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Browser would “only” need to fetch binary file(s) that is already
compiled. So the amount of bytes to fetch would be lot less, and also we
would skip all the compilation steps and just run it directly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Execution Speed</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Whole code is compile to WASM bytecode, so there no need to
re-compile some parts again and again.</li>
<li>Since, the bytecode would already be compiled and optimized by
compiler, the code would run even more faster.</li>
<li>Since, system programming language like C, Rust, Zig, etc is used to
compile to binary, and since they are typically static typed with manual
memory management, we would have more faster code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="additional-benefits">Additional benefits</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)</strong>: WASM
supports vector operations that are native to hardware. With this you
can run calculations that requires doing same operations but on multiple
data, which are typically used in image and signal processing.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Threading</strong>: Although not additional as
javascript can do it with WebWorker API, you can enjoy low over-head
with WASM.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations?</h2>
<hr />
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Although many times WASM is faster
than JS, there are times browser can compile JS to native code (by using
technique called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">Just-In-Time
Compilation</a>) and execute it. It wins when compilation overhead is
lot less than the execution of the said code. Javascript engines such as
JavascriptCore (WebKit, Safari) and V8 (Chromium, Chrome) are capable of
doing this. This can change in coming year, as WASM is still relatively
new technology and JS have been giving years of head start for
optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Javascript can’t be eliminated entirely</strong>: It is not
possible to manipulate DOM’s element directly from WASM, instead it is
done through binding between JS and WASM. Also, just manipulating a
button color (through WASM) doesn’t incur any performance penalty, doing
it repeatedly can become overhead.</li>
